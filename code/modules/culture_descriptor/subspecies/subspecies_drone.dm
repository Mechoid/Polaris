	description = "“Emergence” is a term associated with drone intelligences who become more intelligent than they were originally \
	intended to be. While this can extend to financial systems learning language, for instance, it is usually applied to hypothetical \
	intelligences that become more intelligent than humans. Humanity has a long-standing cultural fear of emergent “seed” AI, egged on by \
	Icarus memeticists and the occasional very real partial emergence events, where colony-control AI or other powerful systems begin to \
	advance drastically in power, usually ending with the AI being shut down after crashing a handful of major systems."
